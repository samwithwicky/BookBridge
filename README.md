# BookBridge

An online book renting service built using Flutter for a cross-platform experience. This application allows users to browse, rent, and manage books seamlessly. This project was built mainly for a demonstration of the idea and much of the backend is yet to be implemented so use the project more as a reference for front end needs.

## Known issues

- I have removed any instances of privates keys and passwords so you will have to initialize your own firebase project and api keys(firebase_options.dart).
- The backend in its current state is not fully functional as it does not link with firebase properly.

## üî≠ Next Steps

- Fix backend and get firebase working with the project.
- Implement a payment gateway for rental fees.
- Add user reviews and a rating system for books.
- Develop an admin panel for managing the book inventory.
- Integrate push notifications for rental reminders.
